    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first notebook, we'll start very simple with one of the most basic models for _NLP_ (natural language processing): a _NBoW_ (_neural bag-of-words_) model (also known as _continuous bag-of-words_, _CBoW_). The NBoW model are a strong, commonly used, baseline model for NLP tasks. They should be one of the first models you implement when performing sentiment analysis/text classification.\n",

    "\n",
    "An NBoW model takes in a sequence of $T$ _tokens_, $X=\\{x_1,...,x_T\\} \\in \\mathbb{Z}^T$ and passes each token through an _embedding layer_ to obtain a sequence of _embedding vectors_. The sequence of embedding vectors is just known as an _embedding_, $E=\\{e_1,...,e_T\\} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times D}$, where $D$ is known as the _embedding dimension_. It then _pools_ the embeddings across the sequence dimension to get $P \\in \\mathbb{R}^D$ and then finally passes $P$ through a linear layer (also known as a fully connected layer), to get a prediction, $\\hat{Y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^C$, where $C$ is the number of classes. We'll explain what a token is, and what each of the layers -- embedding layer, pooling, and linear layer -- do in due course.\n",

In particular she wants to focus her attentions to making some sort of documentary on what the average Swede thought about certain political issues such as the Vietnam War and race issues in the United States. In between asking politicians and ordinary denizens of Stockholm about their opinions on politics, she has sex with her drama teacher, classmates, and married men.<br /><br />What kills me about I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is that 40 years ago, this was considered pornographic. Really, the sex and nudity scenes are few and far between, even then it\\'s not shot like some cheaply made porno. While my countrymen mind find it shocking, in reality sex and nudity are a major staple in Swedish cinema. Even Ingmar Bergman, arguably their answer to good old boy John Ford, had sex scenes in his films.<br /><br />I do commend the filmmakers for the fact that any sex shown in the film is shown for artistic purposes rather than just to shock people and make money to be shown in pornographic theaters in America. I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is a good film for anyone wanting to study the meat and potatoes (no pun intended) of Swedish cinema. But really, this film doesn\\'t have much of a plot.',\n",

    "Why have both a validation set and a test set? Your test set respresents the real world data that you'd see if you actually deployed this model. You won't be able to see what data your model will be fed once deployed, and your test set is supposed to reflect that. Every time we tune our model hyperparameters or training set-up to make it do a bit better on the test set, we are leak information from the test set into the training process. If we do this too often then we begin to overfit on the test set. Hence, we need some data which can act as a \"proxy\" test set which we can look at more frequently in order to evaluate how well our model actually does on unseen data -- this is the validation set.\n",

We use `test_size` to set the portion of the data used for the validation set -- 0.25 means we use 25% of the training set -- and the examples are chosen randomly.\n"

    "### Creating a Vocabulary\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we have to build a _vocabulary_. This is look-up table where every unique token in your dataset has a corresponding _index_ (an integer).\n",
    "\n",
    "We do this as machine learning models cannot operate on strings, only numerical vaslues. Each _index_ is used to construct a _one-hot_ vector for each token. A one-hot vector is a vector where all the elements are 0, except one, which is 1, and the dimensionality is the total number of unique tokens in your vocabulary, commonly denoted by $V$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](assets/vocabulary.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "One issue with creating a vocabulary using every single word in the dataset is that there are usually a considerable amount of unique tokens. One way to combat this is to either only construct the vocabulary only using the most commonly appearing tokens, or to only use tokens which appear a minimum amount of times in the dataset. In this notebook, we do the latter, keeping on the tokens which appear 5 times.\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens to tokens which appear less than 5 times? We replace them with a special _unknown_ token, denoted by `<unk>`. For example, if the sentence \"This film is great and I love it\", but the word \"love\" was not in the vocabulary, it would become: \"This film is great and I \\<unk\\> it\".\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the `build_vocab_from_iterator` function from `torchtext.vocab` to create our vocabulary, specifying the `min_freq` (the minimum amount of times a token should appear to be added to the vocabulary) and `special_tokens` (tokens which should be appended to the start of the vocabulary, even if they don't appear `min_freq` times in the dataset).\n",
    "\n",
    "The first special token is our unknown token, the other, `<pad>` is a special token we'll use for padding sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we feed sentences into our model, we pass a _batch_ of sentences, i.e. more than one, at the same time. Passing a batch of sentences is preferred to passing sentences one at a time as it allows our model to perform computation on all sentences within a batch in parallel, thus speeding up the time taken to train and evaluate our model. All sentences within a batch need to be the same length (in terms of the number of tokens). Thus, to ensure each sentence is the same length, any shorter than the longest sentence need to have padding tokens appended to the end of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an example batch of two sentences of length four and three tokens:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](assets/padding.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see, the second sentence has been padded with a single `<pad>` token.\n"

    "The value of `batch[\"label\"]` should be a tensor of shape `[batch size]` consisting of the label for each sentence in the batch.\n",

Within the actual collate function, `collate_fn`, we get a list of `\"ids\"` tensors for each example in the batch, and then use the `pad_sequence` function, which converts the list of tensors into the desired `[batch size, length]` shaped tensor and performs padding using the specified `pad_index`. By default, `pad_sequence` will return a `[length, batch size]` shaped tensor, but by setting `batch_first=True`, these two dimensions are switched. We get a list of `\"label\"` tensors and convert the list of tensors into a single `[batch size]` shaped tensor.\n"
